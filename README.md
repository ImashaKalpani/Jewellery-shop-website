ðŸ’Ž AURORA CEYLON â€“ Handmade Jewellery Website ðŸ’Ž

Proud to share a project I worked on with my team â€“ a fully functional handmade jewellery website named Aurora Ceylon. âœ¨

We built it using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and connected it to a XAMPP-powered MySQL database for dynamic content management. 
The site showcases unique, handcrafted jewellery pieces, with features for browsing collections, viewing product details, and managing customer inquiries.
